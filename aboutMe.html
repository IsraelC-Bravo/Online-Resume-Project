        <h1><strong>Israel Castillo</strong></h1>
        <h3>Full-Stack Software Engineer</h3>
        <p>
            I'm always looking for creative solutions and strategies to help my
            clients reach their goals, and I believe Coding is the best way to
            make dreams come true. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing board
            games, cooking, walking, playing video games with my kids, reading
            sci-fi related stories and traveling. I'm an avid learner, so I love
            finding answers. I'm a very passionate Software Engineer who's
            constantly thinking what's the next line of code to find the answers
            you need for your unique project. Everybody has an idea, let me hear
            YOURS!
